# Silkworm-Detection-YOLOv5
The project "Silkworm detection using yolov5" aims to develop a deep learning model that can detect silkworms in images. The model will be trained using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm and a dataset created using Roboflow. The expected results are a model that can accurately detect the type of silkworms in images.
